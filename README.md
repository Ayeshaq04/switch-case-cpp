# switch-case-cpp
The C++ Switch case statement evaluates a given expression and based on the evaluated value(matching a certain condition), it executes the statements associated with it. It is an alternative to the long if-else-if ladder which provides an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression.
